This directory contains NEXUS [1] files prepared by Prof. Andy Purvis [2] for his 
supertree of the Primates [3]. The files are organized by higher taxon. Each file contains
a data block with one or more columns. One column is provided as a way to indicate the
polarity of the pseudo-characters: in this column, the hypothetical outgroup has state 0,
and the taxa in the ingroup have state 1. 

Any subsequent columns are obtained from taxonomies, from taxonomic expert statements 
about substructure within higher taxa (e.g. "these species form a group"), from re-coded
characters, or as MRP [4,5] representation of a published tree.
