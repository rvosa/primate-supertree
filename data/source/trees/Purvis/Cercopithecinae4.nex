BEGIN TAXA;
[The original data for the files Cercopithecinae{1-10}.nex uses the genera Macaca and Papio and the
family Cercopithecini. Here, these were expanded to mean all those species for which separate data 
is available from the respective genera. To which genus each belongs was decided on the basis of 
the MSW taxonomy. Lophocebus albigena and L. aterrimus were originally referred to by the synonymous 
Cercocebus. Pruned:
Papio_anubis
Papio_cynocephalus
Papio_papio
Papio_ursinus]
