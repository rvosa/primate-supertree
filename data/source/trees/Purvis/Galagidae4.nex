#NEXUSBEGIN TAXA;[The original data refers to a Galago granti. MSW considers this synonymouswith Galagoides zanzibaricus, and so these two taxa were collapsed into one.The same applies to Euoticus inustus, which is considered synonymous withGalago matschei, and Galagoides thomasi, which is considered synonymous withGalagoides demidoff. In this tree the following specific decisions were taken:* The original data records a '?' for Galago_matschiei, but it has data forEuoticus_inustus, its synonym. This data was used, renamed as Galago_matschiei.* In the original data Galago_granti is considered sister species with Galago_senegalensis. MSW considers Galago_granti synonymous with the - preferred -Galagoides_zanzibaricus. In the data however, this taxon is included separately,as more basal to the aforementioned sister species. I decided to go with theplacement for Galago_granti and rename that Galagoides_zanzibaricus (and prunethe other Galagoides_zanzibaricus). The only other option here is to pruneGalago_granti (and keep Galagoides_zanzibaricus), which would result in oneuninformative polytomy.]	DIMENSIONS NTAX = 10;	TAXLABELS		Galago_alleni		Galago_moholi		Galago_senegalensis		Otolemur_crassicaudatus		Otolemur_garnettii		Euoticus_elegantulus		Galagoides_demidoff		Galagoides_zanzibaricus		Galago_matschiei		purvis_mrp_outgroup		;ENDBLOCK;BEGIN TREES;[Tree shape based on Honacki et al (1982), who say these two were synonymous until recently.]	TRANSLATE		1	Galago_alleni,		2	Galago_moholi,		3	Galago_senegalensis,		4	Otolemur_crassicaudatus,		5	Otolemur_garnettii,		6	Euoticus_elegantulus,		7	Galagoides_demidoff,		8	Galagoides_zanzibaricus,		9	Galago_matschiei,		10	purvis_mrp_outgroup		;	TREE * Galagidae4 = (10,(1,2,4,5,6,7,9,(3,8)));ENDBLOCK;
