#NEXUSBEGIN TAXA;[The original data refers to a Galago granti. MSW considers this synonymouswith Galagoides zanzibaricus, and so these two taxa were collapsed into one.The same applies to Euoticus inustus, which is considered synonymous withGalago matschei, and Galagoides thomasi, which is considered synonymous withGalagoides demidoff. The original data places Galago_matschiei completely basal with all other members of Galago, while its synonym Euoticus_inustus is placed with theother Euoticus and with Galagoides. I have decided to prune the basal Galago_matschiei and use the position of Euoticus_inustus for that species; seeingthat a species that is by e.g. Walker's considered Euoticus_matschei a groupingwith Euoticus_elegantulus would be more appropriate.]	DIMENSIONS NTAX = 9;	TAXLABELS		Galago_alleni		Galago_moholi		Galago_senegalensis		Euoticus_elegantulus		Galagoides_demidoff		Galagoides_zanzibaricus		Galago_gallarum		Galago_matschiei		purvis_mrp_outgroup		;ENDBLOCK;BEGIN TREES;[Tree shape based on Szalay and Delson (1979).
