#NEXUSBEGIN TAXA;[The original data refers to a Galago granti. MSW considers this synonymouswith Galagoides zanzibaricus, and so these two taxa were collapsed into one.The same applies to Euoticus inustus, which is considered synonymous withGalago matschei, and Galagoides thomasi, which is considered synonymous withGalagoides demidoff. In this particular tree the following, specifically, was done:* The original data had a missing data '?' for Galagoides_thomasi, but a data point for Galagoides_demidoff. The two are synonymous, so Galagoides_demidoff'sdata point was included.* The original data had a missing data '?' for Galago matschiei, but not forEuoticus_inustus, which MSW considers its synonym. Euoticus_inustus' data pointwas included, and renamed Galago matschiei]	DIMENSIONS NTAX = 10;	TAXLABELS		Galago_alleni		Galago_moholi		Galago_senegalensis		Otolemur_crassicaudatus		Otolemur_garnettii		Euoticus_elegantulus		Galagoides_demidoff		Galagoides_zanzibaricus		Galago_matschiei		purvis_mrp_outgroup		;ENDBLOCK;BEGIN TREES;[Tree shape based on Zimmermann et al.
