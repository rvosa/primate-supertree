#NEXUSBEGIN TAXA;[The original data refers to a Galago granti. MSW considers this synonymouswith Galagoides zanzibaricus, and so these two taxa were collapsed into one.The same applies to Euoticus inustus, which is considered synonymous withGalago matschei, and Galagoides thomasi, which is considered synonymous withGalagoides demidoff. Here, I decided the following:* The original data included both Galagoides_demidoff and Galagoides_thomasi(which MSW considers synonymous) as descendants from a polytomy. I simplypruned Galagoides_thomasi from that node.* Purvis' data places Euoticus_inustus (Galago matschiei's synonym) is completelybasal in the tree. I pruned Euoticus_inustus and kept Galago matschiei as Euoticus_elegantulus sister species. This placement makes more sense than atthe base, since Galago matschiei is referred to by other authors as Euoticus matschei(specifically by Walker's).* The original data places Galago_granti as completely basal, while its preferredsynonym (Galagoides_zanzibaricus) is placed as a sister species of Galagoides_demidoff.I kept the preferred Galagoides_zanzibaricus and pruned Galago_granti followingthe same logic as for Galago matschiei.]	DIMENSIONS NTAX = 11;	TAXLABELS		Galago_alleni		Galago_moholi		Galago_senegalensis		Otolemur_crassicaudatus		Otolemur_garnettii		Euoticus_elegantulus		Galagoides_demidoff		Galagoides_zanzibaricus		Galago_gallarum		Galago_matschiei		purvis_mrp_outgroup		;ENDBLOCK;BEGIN TREES;[Tree shape based on Olson (1979, in Nash et al 1989, Int J Primat 10, 57-80). Taxonomy but intended to reflect phylogeny so I have rooted it.]	TRANSLATE		1	Galago_alleni,		2	Galago_moholi,		3	Galago_senegalensis,		4	Otolemur_crassicaudatus,		5	Otolemur_garnettii,		6	Euoticus_elegantulus,		7	Galagoides_demidoff,		8	Galagoides_zanzibaricus,		9	Galago_gallarum,		10	Galago_matschiei,		11	purvis_mrp_outgroup		;	TREE * Galagidae5 = (11,((1,(7,8)),((2,3,9),(6,10)),(4,5)));ENDBLOCK;
