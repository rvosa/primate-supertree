This directory contains tree files, in NEXUS format [1], that represent the same 
information as is contained in the [../../mrp/Purvis](../../mrp/Purvis) folder. Here, each
statement, whether it is based on a column to polarize pseudocharacters, columns based on 
taxonomic expertise, re-coded characters, or true source trees, is written out as a 
separate tree file. In addition, any synonymy in the original data is resolved using 
MSW [2].
