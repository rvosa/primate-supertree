MSW considers this synonymouswith Galagoides zanzibaricus, and so these two taxa were collapsed into one.The same applies to Euoticus inustus, which is considered synonymous withGalago matschei, and Galagoides thomasi, which is considered synonymous withGalagoides demidoff.]	DIMENSIONS NTAX = 5;	TAXLABELS		Galago_senegalensis		Otolemur_crassicaudatus		Galagoides_demidoff		Galagoides_zanzibaricus		purvis_mrp_outgroup		;ENDBLOCK;BEGIN TREES;[Tree shape based on Dene et al.
