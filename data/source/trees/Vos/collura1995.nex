BEGIN TREES;
[Tree based on Collura & Stewart (1995) fig 2. MP analysis of cytb. The tree includes
a 'clade' of nuclear insertions of a cytb-like pseudogene that has been pruned here. The
article also shows a tree based on the same data but with other mammal taxa included in
the analysis. As source data, type of analysis and topology are the same for within the
primates that tree has been excluded.]
