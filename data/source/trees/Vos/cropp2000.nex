BEGIN TREES;
[Trees based on Cropp & Boinski 2000:
1. ML analysis of cytb (fig 2f)
2. ML analysis of D-loop (fig 3d)
3. MP analysis of ZFX last intron (fig 4a)
4. MP analysis of IRBP intron 1 (fig 4b)
Other trees in the article are excluded because they were MP when ML was also
available; because they were a consensus over trees shown here or because they
were based on analysis of combined data separate results of which are shown here.]
