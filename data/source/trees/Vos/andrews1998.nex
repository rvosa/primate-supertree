prefers Otolemur crassicaudatus, so this was changed.]

BEGIN TREES;
[The article shows three trees in Fig 3. Tree 3B is a consensus
over 3A plus all trees that aren't significantly worse, while 3C
was constrained to the received wisdom on mammalian phylogenetic
relationships. All three trees are based on the same data - 3A
has the best score, so that tree is used here. Based on Cytochrome
b, analysed under maximum likelihood.]
